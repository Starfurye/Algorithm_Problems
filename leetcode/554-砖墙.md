# LC-0554. Brick Wall

There is a rectangular brick wall in front of you with `n` rows of bricks. The `ith` row has some number of bricks each of the same height (i.e., one unit) but they can be of different widths. The total width of each row is the same.

Draw a vertical line from the top to the bottom and cross the least bricks. If your line goes through the edge of a brick, then the brick is not considered as crossed. You cannot draw a line just along one of the two vertical edges of the wall, in which case the line will obviously cross no bricks.

Given the 2D array `wall` that contains the information about the wall, return _the minimum number of crossed bricks after drawing such a vertical line_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: wall = [[1,2,2,1],[3,1,2],[1,3,2],[2,4],[3,1,2],[1,3,1,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: wall = [[1],[1],[1]]
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == wall.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 10^4`
-   `1 <= wall[i].length <= 10^4`
-   `1 <= sum(wall[i].length) <= 2 * 10^4`
-   `sum(wall[i])` is the same for each row `i`.
-   `1 <= wall[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution

遍历砖墙的每一行，对于当前行，从左到右地扫描每一块砖，使用一个累加器记录当前砖的右侧边缘到砖墙的左边缘的距离，将除了最右侧的砖块以外的其他砖块的右边缘到整个砖墙的左边缘的距离加入到哈希表中。最后遍历该哈希表，找到出现次数最多的砖块边缘，这就是垂线经过的砖块边缘，而该垂线经过的砖块数量即为砖墙的高度减去该垂线经过的砖块边缘的数量。

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} wall
 * @return {number}
 */
var leastBricks = function (wall) {
    const counter = new Map();
    for (const widths of wall) {
        const len = widths.length;
        let sum = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < len - 1; i++) {
            sum += widths[i];
            // 统计从左到右宽度为sum的右边缘的个数
            counter.set(sum, (counter.get(sum) || 0) + 1);
        }
    }

    let maxCount = 0;
    for (const [width, c] of counter.entries()) {
        maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, c);
    }
    return wall.length - maxCount;
};
```
