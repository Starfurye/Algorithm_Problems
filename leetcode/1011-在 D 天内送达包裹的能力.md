# 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days

A conveyor belt has packages that must be shipped from one port to another within `D` days.

The ith package on the conveyor belt has a weight of `weights[i]`. Each day, we load the ship with packages on the conveyor belt (in the order given by `weights`). We may not load more weight than the maximum weight capacity of the ship.

Return the least weight capacity of the ship that will result in all the packages on the conveyor belt being shipped within `D` days.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], D = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship capacity of 15 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 5 days like this:
1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
2nd day: 6, 7
3rd day: 8
4th day: 9
5th day: 10

Note that the cargo must be shipped in the order given, so using a ship of capacity 14 and splitting the packages into parts like (2, 3, 4, 5), (1, 6, 7), (8), (9), (10) is not allowed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: weights = [3,2,2,4,1,4], D = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: A ship capacity of 6 is the minimum to ship all the packages in 3 days like this:
1st day: 3, 2
2nd day: 2, 4
3rd day: 1, 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: weights = [1,2,3,1,1], D = 4
Output: 3
Explanation:
1st day: 1
2nd day: 2
3rd day: 3
4th day: 1, 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= D <= weights.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= weights[i] <= 500`

## Solution

### 二分

本质为查找最小的运载能力使得运送天数小于等于D，为左边界问题。

```js
/**
 * @param {number[]} weights
 * @param {number} D
 * @return {number}
 */
var shipWithinDays = function(weights, D) {
    let left = Math.max(...weights);                // 最大值
    let right = weights.reduce((a, b) => a + b);    // 求和
    while (left < right) {
        const mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
        let days = 1, sum = 0;
        for (const weight of weights) {             // 计算mid对应的天数
            if (sum + weight > mid) {
                days++;
                sum = 0;
            }
            sum += weight;
        }

        if (days === D) {               //  D天内能送完，mid还能更小吗
            right = mid;
        } else if (days < D) {          // 不到D天就能送完，说明mid过大了
            right = mid;
        } else if (days > D) {          // D天内送不完，说明mid过小了
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return left;
};
```
