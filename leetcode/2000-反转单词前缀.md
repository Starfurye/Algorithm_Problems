# 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word

Given a **0-indexed** string `word` and a character `ch`, **reverse** the segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the **first occurrence** of ch (**inclusive**). If the character `ch` does not exist in word, do nothing.

-   For example, if `word = "abcdefd"` and `ch = "d"`, then you should **reverse** the segment that starts at `0` and ends at `3` (**inclusive**). The resulting string will be `"dcbaefd"`.
    Return the resulting string.

Example 1:

```
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
```

Example 2:

```
Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first and only occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
```

Example 3:

```
Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should not do any reverse operation, the resulting string is "abcd".
```

Constraints:

-   `1 <= word.length <= 250`
-   `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
-   `ch` is a lowercase English letter.

## Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @param {character} ch
 * @return {string}
 */

let next = [];
var reversePrefix = function (word, ch) {
    buildNext(word, ch);
    let index = match(word, ch);
    let arr = Array.from(word);
    let front = arr.slice(0, index + ch.length);
    let end = arr.slice(index + ch.length);
    return front.reverse().join("") + end.join("");
};

// KMP
function buildNext(s, p) {
    next.push(0);
    let i = 1,
        now = 0;
    while (i < p.length) {
        if (p[now] == p[i]) {
            now++;
            i++;
            next.push(now);
        } else if (now > 0) {
            now = next[now - 1];
        } else {
            next.push(0);
            i++;
        }
    }
}
function match(s, p) {
    let pS = 0,
        pP = 0;
    while (pS < s.length) {
        if (s[pS] == p[pP]) {
            pS++;
            pP++;
        } else if (pP > 0) {
            pP = next[pP - 1];
        } else pS++;

        if (pP == p.length) {
            return pS - pP;
        }
    }
}
```
