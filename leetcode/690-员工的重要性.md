# 690. Employee Importance

You are given a data structure of employee information, which includes the employee's **unique id**, their **importance value** and their **direct** subordinates' id.

For example, employee 1 is the leader of employee 2, and employee 2  is the leader of employee 3. They have importance value 15, 10 and 5,  respectively. Then employee 1 has a data structure like [1, 15, [2]],  and employee 2 has [2, 10, [3]], and employee 3 has [3, 5, []]. Note  that although employee 3 is also a subordinate of employee 1, the  relationship is **not direct**.

Now given the employee information of a company, and an employee id,  you need to return the total importance value of this employee and all  their subordinates.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1, 5, [2, 3]], [2, 3, []], [3, 3, []]], 1
Output: 11
Explanation:
Employee 1 has importance value 5, and he has two direct subordinates: employee 2 and employee 3. They both have importance value 3. So the total importance value of employee 1 is 5 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```

 

**Note:**

1. One employee has at most one **direct** leader and may have several subordinates.
2. The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.

## Solution

### BFS

```js
/**
 * Definition for Employee.
 * function Employee(id, importance, subordinates) {
 *     this.id = id;
 *     this.importance = importance;
 *     this.subordinates = subordinates;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {Employee[]} employees
 * @param {number} id
 * @return {number}
 */
var GetImportance = function(employees, id) {
    let res = 0;
    const map = new Map();					// 使用哈希表对应
    for (const employee of employees) {
        map.set(employee.id, employee);
    }
    const queue = [];
    queue.push(id);
    while (queue.length) {
        const cur = queue.shift();
        const employee = map.get(cur);
        res += employee.importance;
        const subordinates = employee.subordinates;
        for (const sub of subordinates) {
            queue.push(sub);
        }
    }

    return res;
};
```

### DFS

```js
/**
 * Definition for Employee.
 * function Employee(id, importance, subordinates) {
 *     this.id = id;
 *     this.importance = importance;
 *     this.subordinates = subordinates;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {Employee[]} employees
 * @param {number} id
 * @return {number}
 */
var GetImportance = function(employees, id) {
    const map = new Map();
    for (const employee of employees) {
        map.set(employee.id, employee);
    }
    const dfs = (id) => {
        const employee = map.get(id);
        let res = employee.importance;
        const subordinates = employee.subordinates;
        for (let sub of subordinates) {
            res += dfs(sub);
        }
        return res;
    }
    return dfs(id);
};
```
