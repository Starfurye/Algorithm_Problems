We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns 3 possible results:

* `-1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. `pick < num`).
* `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. `pick > num`).
* `0`: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. `pick == num`).

Return *the number that I picked*.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```
**Example 2:**
```text
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```
**Example 3:**
```text
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```
**Example 4:**
```text
Input: n = 2, pick = 2
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
* `1 <= pick <= n`

## Solution

```java
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num   your guess
 * @return 	     -1 if num is lower than the guess number
 *			      1 if num is higher than the guess number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * int guess(int num);

            int cur = guess(mid);
