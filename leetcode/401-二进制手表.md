# LC-0401. Binary Watch

A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

-   For example, the below binary watch reads `"4:51"`.

Given an integer `turnedOn` which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return _all possible times the watch could represent_. You may return the answer in **any order**.

The hour must not contain a leading zero.

-   For example, `"01:00"` is not valid. It should be `"1:00"`.

The minute must be consist of two digits and may contain a leading zero.

-   For example, `"10:2"` is not valid. It should be `"10:02"`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: turnedOn = 1
Output: ["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32","1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: turnedOn = 9
Output: []
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= turnedOn <= 10`

## Solution

### 枚举

分钟和小时一共有 10 位，可以枚举这 1024 个数，统计其二进制形式中的 1 的个数，若等于`turnedOn`即符合题意。

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} turnedOn
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var readBinaryWatch = function (turnedOn) {
    const ans = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < 1024; ++i) {
        let h = i >> 6,
            m = i & 63; // 用位运算取出高 4 位和低 6 位
        if (
            h < 12 &&
            m < 60 &&
            i.toString(2).split("0").join("").length === turnedOn
        ) {
            // toString(radix)
            ans.push(h + ":" + (m < 10 ? "0" : "") + m);
        }
    }
    return ans;
};
```
