# LC-0200. Number of Islands

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid grid which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

Example 1:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
Output: 1
```

Example 2:

```
Input: grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
Output: 3
```

Constraints:

-   `m == grid.length`
-   `n == grid[i].length`
-   `1 <= m, n <= 300`
-   `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution

### DFS

```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var numIslands = function (grid) {
    const dfs = (row, col) => {
        if (
            row < 0 ||
            row >= grid.length ||
            col < 0 ||
            col >= grid[0].length ||
            grid[row][col] === "0"
        )
            return;

        // 清除标记
        grid[row][col] = "0";
        dfs(row - 1, col);
        dfs(row, col + 1);
        dfs(row + 1, col);
        dfs(row, col - 1);
    };

    if (!grid || grid.length === 0) return 0;
    let ans = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === "1") {
                ans++;
                dfs(i, j);
            }
        }
    }
    return ans;
};
```
