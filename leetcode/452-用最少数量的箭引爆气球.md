# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

There are some spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter, and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. The start is always smaller than the end.

An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` bursts by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart ≤ x ≤ xend`. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps traveling up infinitely.

Given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]`, return _the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= points.length <= 10^4`
-   `points[i].length == 2`
-   `-2^31 <= x_start < x_end <= 2^31 - 1`

## Solution

如果气球重叠了，重叠气球中右边边界的最小值 之前的区间一定需要一个弓箭。

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
var findMinArrowShots = function (points) {
    if (points.length === 0) return 0;
    points.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    let res = 1; // 至少需要一支箭
    for (let i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
        if (points[i][0] > points[i - 1][1]) {
            // 气球i和气球i-1不挨着
            res++;
        } else {
            // 气球i和气球i-1挨着
            points[i][1] = Math.min(points[i - 1][1], points[i][1]); // 更新重叠气球最小右边界
        }
    }
    return res;
};
```
