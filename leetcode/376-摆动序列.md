# 376. Wiggle Subsequence

A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with one element and a sequence with two non-equal elements are trivially wiggle sequences.

-   For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a **wiggle sequence** because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` alternate between positive and negative.
-   In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

A **subsequence** is obtained by deleting some elements (possibly zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.

Given an integer array `nums`, return _the length of the longest **wiggle subsequence** of_ `nums`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]
Output: 6
Explanation: The entire sequence is a wiggle sequence with differences (6, -3, 5, -7, 3).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length.
One is [1, 17, 10, 13, 10, 16, 8] with differences (16, -7, 3, -3, 6, -8).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
-   `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

**Follow up:** Could you solve this in `O(n)` time?

## Solution

### 贪心

当数组只有两个数时，无法比较 pre 和 cur，需要默认一个峰值，这里设最右边为峰值。

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var wiggleMaxLength = function (nums) {
    if (nums.length <= 1) return nums.length;
    let cur = 0; // 当前差值
    let pre = 0; // 前一对数之间的差值
    let peak = 1; // 峰值个数即结果元素个数，默认最右边有一个峰值
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        cur = nums[i + 1] - nums[i];
        if ((pre <= 0 && cur > 0) || (pre >= 0 && cur < 0)) {
            peak++;
            pre = cur;
        }
    }
    return peak;
};
```
