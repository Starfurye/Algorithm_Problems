# LC-0275. H-Index II

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper and `citations` is sorted in an **ascending order**, return compute the researcher's `h`-**index**.

According to the _definition of h-index on Wikipedia_: A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n − h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

-   `n == citations.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 105`
-   `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
-   `citations` is sorted in **ascending order**.

**Follow up:** Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

#### javascript

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} citations
 * @return {number}
 */
var hIndex = function (citations) {
    let len = citations.length;
    let left = 0;
    let right = len;
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor(left + (right - left) / 2);
        if (citations[mid] === len - mid) return len - mid;
        else if (citations[mid] < len - mid) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else if (citations[mid] > len - mid) {
            right = mid;
        }
    }
    return len - left;
};
```

#### java

```java
class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int len = citations.length;
        int left = 0;
        int right = len;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if(citations[mid] == len - mid) return len - mid;	// 如果citations[mid] == len - mid，那么h指数刚好是citations[mid]
            else if (citations[mid] < len - mid) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else if (citations[mid] > len - mid) {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return len - left;
    }
}
```
