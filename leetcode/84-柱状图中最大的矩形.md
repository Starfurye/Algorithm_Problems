# 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram

Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return _the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram_.

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/histogram.jpg)

```
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
```

Example 2:

```
Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
```

Constraints:

-   `1 <= heights.length <= 10^5`
-   `0 <= heights[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        res = 0
        heights = [0] + heights + [0]   # 放入哨兵
        stack = [0]
        for i in range(1, len(heights)):
            while heights[i] < heights[stack[-1]]:
                cur_height = heights[stack.pop()]
                cur_width = i - stack[-1] - 1
                res = max(res, cur_height * cur_width)
            stack.append(i)
        return res

```
