# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates *in-place* such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by **modifying the input array** *in-place* with O(1) extra memory.

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer, but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller.

Internally you can think of this:
```text
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```
**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```
**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3]
Output: 7, nums = [0,0,1,1,2,3,3]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```


**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
* `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
* `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

## Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int realLength = nums.length;			// 最终数组中的元素个数
        int[] move = new int[realLength];		// 存储向前移位位数的数组
        int count = 1, last = nums[0], allcount = 0; // count:当前元素的重复个数，last:上一个元素，allcount:大于两个的重复元素的个数
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == last) {
                ++count;
                if (count > 2) {
                    ++allcount;
                    --realLength;
                }
            } else {
                count = 1;
            }
            last = nums[i];
            move[i] = allcount;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < move.length; ++i) {
            nums[i - move[i]] = nums[i];
        }
        return realLength;
    }
}
```
