# LC-0328. Odd Even Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return _the reordered list_.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

**Example 1:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```

**Example 2:**
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[0, 10^4]`.
-   `-10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6`

## Solution

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * function ListNode(val, next) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
 * }
 */
/**
 * @param {ListNode} head
 * @return {ListNode}
 */
var oddEvenList = function (head) {
    // oddHead -> evenHead -> head -> ...
    let evenHead = new ListNode(-1, head);
    let oddHead = new ListNode(-1, evenHead);
    let p0 = null,
        p1 = oddHead,
        p2 = evenHead; // p0用于偶数个结点的情况
    let count = 0;
    while (p2) {
        p1.next = p2.next;
        [p0, p1, p2] = [p1, p2, p2.next];
        count++;
    }
    // oddHead -> ... -> (evenHead) -> ...
    if ((count - 1) % 2 === 1) {
        p1.next = evenHead.next;
    } else {
        p0.next = evenHead.next;
    }
    return oddHead.next;
};
```
