# 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List

You are given a doubly linked list which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer, which may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

Flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
Output: [1,2,3,7,8,11,12,9,10,4,5,6]
Explanation:

The multilevel linked list in the input is as follows:



After flattening the multilevel linked list it becomes:
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,null,3]
Output: [1,3,2]
Explanation:

The input multilevel linked list is as follows:

  1---2---NULL
  |
  3---NULL
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**How multilevel linked list is represented in test case:**

We use the multilevel linked list from **Example 1** above:

```
 1---2---3---4---5---6--NULL
         |
         7---8---9---10--NULL
             |
             11--12--NULL
```

The serialization of each level is as follows:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[7,8,9,10,null]
[11,12,null]
```

To serialize all levels together we will add nulls in each level to signify no node connects to the upper node of the previous level. The serialization becomes:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null]
[null,null,7,8,9,10,null]
[null,11,12,null]
```

Merging the serialization of each level and removing trailing nulls we obtain:

```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8,9,10,null,null,11,12]
```

**Constraints:**

-   The number of Nodes will not exceed `1000`.
-   `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Solution

```javascript
var flatten = function (head) {
    const dfs = (node) => {
        let cur = node;
        // 记录链表的最后一个节点
        let last = null;

        while (cur) {
            let next = cur.next;
            //  如果有子节点，那么首先处理子节点
            if (cur.child) {
                const childLast = dfs(cur.child);

                next = cur.next;
                //  将 node 与 child 相连
                cur.next = cur.child;
                cur.child.prev = cur;

                //  如果 next 不为空，就将 last 与 next 相连
                if (next != null) {
                    childLast.next = next;
                    next.prev = childLast;
                }

                // 将 child 置为空
                cur.child = null;
                last = childLast;
            } else {
                last = cur;
            }
            cur = next;
        }
        return last;
    };

    dfs(head);
    return head;
};
```
