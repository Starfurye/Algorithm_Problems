# LC-0664. Strange Printer

There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:

-   The printer can only print a sequence of **the same character** each time.
-   At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will cover the original existing characters.

Given a string `s`, return _the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of the string, which will cover the existing character 'a'.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
-   `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

```java
class Solution {
    public int strangePrinter(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] f = new int[n][n];
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            f[i][i] = 1;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    f[i][j] = f[i][j - 1];
                } else {
                    int minn = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                    for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
                        minn = Math.min(minn, f[i][k] + f[k + 1][j]);
                    }
                    f[i][j] = minn;
                }
            }
        }
        return f[0][n - 1];
    }
}
```
