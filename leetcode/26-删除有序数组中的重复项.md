# LC-0026. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted array _nums_, remove the duplicates _in-place_ such that each element appears only _once_ and returns the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array** _in-place_ with O(1) extra memory.

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means a modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```C++
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively. It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
-   `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
-   `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

## Solution

### 双指针（快慢指针）

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function (nums) {
    const len = nums.length;
    if (len === 0) {
        return 0;
    } else if (len === 1) {
        return 1;
    }

    let i = 0;
    for (let j = i + 1; j < len; j++) {
        if (nums[j] !== nums[j - 1]) {
            i++;
            nums[i] = nums[j];
        }
    }
    return i + 1;
};
```
