# LC-1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer

The **complement** of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the `0`'s to `1`'s and all the `1`'s to `0`'s in its binary representation.

-   For example, The integer `5` is `"101"` in binary and its **complement** is `"010"` which is the integer `2`.

Given an integer `n`, return _its complement_.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 is "101" in binary, with complement "010" in binary, which is 2 in base-10.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 7
Output: 0
Explanation: 7 is "111" in binary, with complement "000" in binary, which is 0 in base-10.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: 10 is "1010" in binary, with complement "0101" in binary, which is 5 in base-10.
```

**Constraints:**

-   `0 <= n < 10^9`

**Note:** This question is the same as 476: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-complement/

## Solution

注意本题 n 可以等于 0。

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var bitwiseComplement = function (n) {
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    let i = 0,
        temp = n,
        ans = 0;
    while (temp !== 0) {
        let lsb = temp & 1;
        ans += lsb === 0 ? 1 * Math.pow(2, i) : 0;
        i++;
        temp >>= 1;
    }
    return ans;
};
```
