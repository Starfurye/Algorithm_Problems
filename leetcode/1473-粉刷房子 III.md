# 1473. Paint House III*

There is a row of `m` houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the `n` colors (labeled from `1` to `n`), some houses that have been painted last summer should not be painted again.

A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.

- For example: `houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1]` contains `5` neighborhoods `[{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2}, {1,1}]`.

Given an array `houses`, an `m x n` matrix `cost` and an integer `target` where:

- `houses[i]`: is the color of the house `i`, and `0` if the house is not painted yet.
- `cost[i][j]`: is the cost of paint the house `i` with the color `j + 1`.

Return *the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly* `target` *neighborhoods*. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Paint houses of this way [1,2,2,1,1]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{1}, {2,2}, {1,1}].
Cost of paint all houses (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: houses = [0,2,1,2,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
Output: 11
Explanation: Some houses are already painted, Paint the houses of this way [2,2,1,2,2]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{2,2}, {1}, {2,2}]. 
Cost of paint the first and last house (10 + 1) = 11.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[1,10],[10,1],[1,10]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 5
Output: 5
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: houses = [3,1,2,3], cost = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], m = 4, n = 3, target = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: Houses are already painted with a total of 4 neighborhoods [{3},{1},{2},{3}] different of target = 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == houses.length == cost.length`
- `n == cost[i].length`
- `1 <= m <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `1 <= target <= m`
- `0 <= houses[i] <= n`
- `1 <= cost[i][j] <= 10^4`

## Solution

```js
var minCost = function(houses, cost, m, n, target) {
    // 将颜色调整为从 0 开始编号，没有被涂色标记为 -1
    houses = houses.map(c => --c);
    const dp = new Array(m).fill(0)
                           .map(() => new Array(n).fill(0)
                           .map(() => new Array(target).fill(Number.MAX_VALUE)));
    
    // dp 所有元素初始化为极大值
    for (let i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            if (houses[i] !== -1 && houses[i] !== j) {
                continue;
            }
            
            for (let k = 0; k < target; ++k) {
                for (let j0 = 0; j0 < n; ++j0) {
                    if (j === j0) {
                        if (i === 0) {
                            if (k === 0) {
                                dp[i][j][k] = 0;
                            }
                        } else {
                            dp[i][j][k] = Math.min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][j][k]);
                        }
                    } else if (i > 0 && k > 0) {
                        dp[i][j][k] = Math.min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][j0][k - 1]);
                    }
                }

                if (dp[i][j][k] !== Number.MAX_VALUE && houses[i] === -1) {
                    dp[i][j][k] += cost[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    let ans = Number.MAX_VALUE;
    for (let j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
        ans = Math.min(ans, dp[m - 1][j][target - 1]);
    }
    return ans === Number.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : ans;
};
