# 89. Gray Code

An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of `2^n` integers where:

-   Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2n - 1],
-   The first integer is 0,
-   An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
-   The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
-   The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.
    Given an integer `n`, return _any valid n-bit gray code sequence_.

Example 1:

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 00 differ by one bit
```

Example 2:

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]
```

Constraints:

-   `1 <= n <= 16`

## Solution

### 镜像反射法

```js
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var grayCode = function (n) {
    const res = [0];
    let head = 1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = res.length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            res.push(head + res[j]);
        }
        head <<= 1;
    }
    return res;
};
```
