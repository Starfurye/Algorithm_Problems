# 482. License Key Formatting

You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

Return *the reformatted license key*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, and dashes `'-'`.
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`

## Solution

```js
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {string}
 */
var licenseKeyFormatting = function(s, k) {
    let s2 = s.split("").filter((c) => c !== '-').map((c) => c.toUpperCase());
    let ans = [];
    let len = s2.length;
    let m = Math.floor(len / k);
    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++){
        ans.unshift(s2.slice(len - i * k, len - (i - 1) * k).join(""));
    }
    if (len % k) ans.unshift(s2.slice(0, len - m * k).join(""));	// 如果不能整除加上第一组
    return ans.join("-");
};
```
